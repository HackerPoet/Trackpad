## How To Use
* You need a keyboard layout image "layout.png".  I included an example in the zip file.
* Next, label the keys.  Press "F2" to start the editor mode.  Click on the top left of a key, then the bottom right, then type the key.  Do this for all keys you want to use.
* Press "S" to save your key labels to "layout.bin".  I included an example of this as well.
* Press "F2" to switch back to idle.
* You can now toggle the keyboard on and off with "F1".
* Drag a finger over the keyboard to move the mouse.  Double-tap a key to click or start dragging.  2 fingers scroll.
* "Esc" will always shut down the app and release the hook in case you get stuck.
